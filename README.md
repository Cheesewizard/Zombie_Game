Current progress of the game. Started adding collectables, the framework is in place but havent fully implemented it yet so its rough around the edges. Contains a lot of changes as detailed in my commits.

New animated hitboxes for the zombies allowing for more accurate triggers. Individual components can lead the way to determining where the zombie has been shot for statistics or other animated effects.
